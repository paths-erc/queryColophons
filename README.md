## Browser support
This software is targeted to modern browsers and makes use of features not
supported in older ones, like:
- [@font-face](https://caniuse.com/#search=%40font-face) for loading [Antinoou font](https://www.evertype.com/fonts/coptic/) used to render Coptic
- [fetch](https://caniuse.com/#search=fetch) used to get data from GitHub
- [Promise](https://caniuse.com/#search=Promise) for async operations
- ES6 variables

There is no plan to support in the future older browsers.
